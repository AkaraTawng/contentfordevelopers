### Why contribute to this repo?

We aim to please users with not just another solution bank to leetcode problems, but MORE. Contributors are encouraged to upload and share any additional content such as visual diagrams, animated GIFs, notes, charts, or whatever they use to not only solve, but UNDERSTAND the problem at hand.

Well, we all know that there are countless resources for basically any topic in web development out there. So no, this is NOT just another resource that regurgitates info and slaps their logo on it. This is an effort to not only provide solutions to `Data Structures and Algorithms` problems, but to take each one a step or two further by including easy-to-follow, broken down explanations of each step.
