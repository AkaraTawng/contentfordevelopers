# Sliding Window

A pattern used when given an `array` or `linked list`, we need to perform a required operation on a specific window size.

To identify the Sliding Window:
- Input is a linear data structure (array, linked list, or a string)
- Goal is to find the longest/shortest subarray, substring, or desired value

Problem that can be solved using the Sliding Window:
- Maximum sum subarray of size ‘K’ (easy)
- Longest substring with ‘K’ distinct characters (medium)
- String anagrams (hard)
